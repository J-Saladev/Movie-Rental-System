Hello! I began this project so I could learn how to make my programs easier to work on for other 
developers. I use sequelize so that other developers don't have to make a database from scratch, 
and so when I make a change anyone who has previously set it up is able to update it easily.
This is a full stack application using Vue.JS, Express.JS, and MySQL.

## How to use

-----------------------------------
### Install
Begin by cloning my project from github onto your device.
```mdkir Movie-Rental-System```
```sh git clone https://github.com/J-Saladev/Movie-Rental-System.git```
